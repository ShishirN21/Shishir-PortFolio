        Hi, I'm Shishir Nath — a Computational Science student with a deep passion for artificial intelligence and intelligent systems. I explore the boundaries between code, cognition, and creativity, currently studying at the University of South Carolina Beaufort (GPA: 3.7/4.0).

I love designing intelligent tools that not only work — but learn, adapt, and enhance human experience. Whether it’s building immersive VR education experiences, full-stack web platforms, or experimenting with data-driven models, I’m all about creating the future, one algorithm at a time.

Languages I speak? Python, Java, JavaScript — but also design, data, and collaboration.
